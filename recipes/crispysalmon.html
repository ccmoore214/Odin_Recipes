        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>Onion Powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Line the bottom of a baking dish with foil.</li>
        <li>While oven is preheating add your seasoning to both sides of salmon fillet and place on foil.</li>
        <li>Bake salmon in oven for 10 to 12 min.</li>
        <li>After your timer goes off, without taking salmon out of oven turn your oven to broil. 
            Let the salmon broil for 3 to 4 minutes.  <strong>VERY IMPORTANT</strong>: Don't leave the salmon unattended
            at this point because it can burn very easily.  You may have to take salmon out of oven before
